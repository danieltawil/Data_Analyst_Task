# Data_Analyst_Task
What to expect
1.	For the mock data, I assumed 5 clients, 1 month of daily financial data and 15 loans in total.
2.	Both the SQL and Python codes automatically update the Financials table daily, assuming a new updated TXT file is received in our folder.
3.	The dashboard contains 4 graphs, out of the 5 suggested on the task. The mock data was uploaded to the dashboard with Excel files to avoid server connection problems in the submission, but the data in the dashboard matches exactly with the coded database.
